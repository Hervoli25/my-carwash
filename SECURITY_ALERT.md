### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required (Within 24 Hours)

#### 1. DATABASE CREDENTIALS COMPROMISED
- **WHAT**: Your production database credentials were exposed in the repository
- **EXPOSED**: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Ku1tsfTV4qze@ep-odd-feather-ab7njs2z-pooler.eu-west-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

  3. Restart your application

#### 2. NEXTAUTH SECRET EXPOSED
- **WHAT**: Your NextAuth secret key was exposed
- **EXPOSED**: `ekhaya-car-wash-secret-key-2024`
- **ACTION REQUIRED**:
  1. Generate a new secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`
  2. Update `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables
  3. This will invalidate all existing user sessions (users need to log in again)

#### 3. API KEY EXPOSED
- **WHAT**: Your CRM API key was exposed
- **EXPOSED**: `ekhaya-car-wash-secret-key-2024`
- **ACTION REQUIRED**:
  1. Generate a new API key: `openssl rand -hex 32`
  2. Update `CRM_API_KEY` in Vercel environment variables
  3. Update any CRM integrations with the new key

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY - Action Required (This Week)

#### 4. ADMIN PASSWORD SECURITY
- **WHAT**: Admin password was hardcoded in scripts
- **FIXED**: Now uses environment variables
- **ACTION REQUIRED**:
  1. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable with a strong password
  2. Run the admin creation script: `npm run create-admin`
  3. Enable 2FA for all admin accounts

#### 5. TEST CREDENTIALS
- **WHAT**: Test user password was hardcoded
- **FIXED**: Now uses environment variables
- **ACTION REQUIRED**:
  1. Set `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` environment variable
  2. For production: disable or remove test accounts

### âœ… Security Fixes Applied

The following security improvements have been implemented in the code:

1. **Removed** `.env.production` with exposed credentials
2. **Created** `.env.production.template` with secure placeholders
3. **Added** comprehensive `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` documentation
4. **Implemented** security validation script (`npm run security:check`)
5. **Enhanced** environment variable usage throughout the application
6. **Updated** all documentation to remove default credentials
7. **Strengthened** `.gitignore` to prevent future credential exposure

### ðŸ”§ How to Deploy Securely

1. **Environment Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Copy template and fill with secure values
   cp .env.production.template .env.production
   # Edit .env.production with your secure credentials
   # NEVER commit this file to version control
   ```

2. **Generate Secure Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Generate NextAuth secret
   openssl rand -base64 32
   
   # Generate API key
   openssl rand -hex 32
   
   # Generate admin password
   openssl rand -base64 20
   ```

3. **Run Security Check**:
   ```bash
   npm run security:check
   ```

4. **Create Admin User**:
   ```bash
   export ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
   npm run create-admin
   ```
